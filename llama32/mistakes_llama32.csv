You can precisely formulate and encode different text statements into Answer Set Programming encoding.,Polly is not herbivorous.,"Here are the copied sentences:

1. Polly is not herbivorous.
2. 
3.",,"Based on the provided problems, I will format the constants according to the rules. Here are the formatted constants:

**Problem 1**

* Constants:
	+ index_of_row: 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8.
	+ index_of_column: 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8.

Formatted constants:
row_index: 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8.
column_index: 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8.

**Problem 2**

* Constants:
	+ employee: ""Bonita""; ""Yvette""; ""Tabitha"".
	+ price: 225; 275; 325.
	+ wood_type: ""ash""; ""poplar""; ""sandalwood"".

Formatted constants:
employee: ""bonita""; ""yvette""; ""tabitha"".
price: 225; 275; 325.
wood_type: ""ash""; ""poplar""; ""sandalwood"".

**Problem 3**

* Constants:
	+ months: January; April; October; December.
	+ times: 8:30AM; 10:30AM; 2:30PM; 3:30PM.
	+ durations: 1 day; 3 days; 11 days; 12 days.

Formatted constants:
month: ""january""; ""april""; ""october""; ""december"".
time: ""8:30am""; ""10:30pm""; ""2:30pm""; ""3:30pm"".
duration: ""1 day""; ""3 days""; ""11 days""; ""12 days"".

Note that for Problem 3, I used the double quote format for all constants since no integer can represent the time and duration values.","I'll provide the minimum number of predicates to define the relations among the categories of constants for each problem.

**Problem 1**

To ensure that each queen is assigned a unique row and column, we need at least one predicate per category. We can use the following predicates:

- `assign(Ir, Ic)`: Assigns a queen at row Ir and column Ic.
- `not_assign(Ir, Ic)`: Ensures that no two queens share the same row or column.

However, since we want to avoid using the `not` predicate unnecessarily, we can use a single predicate with two clauses:

```prolog
assign(Ir, Ic).
not_assign(Ir1, Ic1), assign(Ir2, Ic2), Ir1 \= Ir2, Ic1 \= Ic2.
```

**Problem 2**

To match each item to the employee who crafted it and determine its price and wood type, we need at least one predicate per category. We can use the following predicates:

- `match(E, P, W)`: Matches an employee E with price P and wood type W.

However, since we want to avoid using the `match` predicate unnecessarily, we can use a single predicate with three clauses:

```prolog
match(E, P, W).
match(E1, P1, W1), match(E2, P2, W2), E \= E1, P \= P1, W \= W1.
```

**Problem 3**

To ensure that Polly is not herbivorous and that each sheep is herbivorous, we need at least one predicate per category. We can use the following predicates:

- `not_herbivorous(Polly)`: Ensures that Polly is not herbivorous.

However, since we want to avoid using the `not` predicate unnecessarily, we can use a single predicate with two clauses:

```prolog
not_herbivorous(Polly).
herbivorous(Sheep).
```

Note that this problem doesn't require any predicates for the months, times, and durations constants.","Based on the provided problems, I will generate ASP rules to define the relations among the categories of constants. Here are the ASP rules:

**Problem 1**

```prolog
% Define the constants in each category.
row_index(1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8).
column_index(1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8).

% For each row index, it matches with exactly one column index.
{row_index(Ir): column_index(Ic)}=1 :- row_index(Ir), column_index(Ic).

% Ensure that no two queens share the same row or column.
not_assign(Row, Col1), not_assign(Row2, Col2), Row \= Row2, Col1 \= Col2.
```

**Problem 2**

```prolog
% Define the constants in each category.
employee(""bonita""; ""yvette""; ""tabitha"").
price(225; 275; 325).
wood_type(""ash""; ""poplar""; ""sandalwood"").

% For each employee, it matches with exactly one price and one wood type.
{employee(E): price(P), wood_type(W)}=1 :- employee(E).

% Ensure that no two items share the same employee, price, or wood type.
not_assign(E1, P1, W1), not_assign(E2, P2, W2), E1 \= E2, P1 \= P2, W1 \= W2.
```

**Problem 3**

```prolog
% Define the constants in each category.
month(""january""; ""april""; ""october""; ""december"").
time(""8:30am""; ""10:30pm""; ""2:30pm""; ""3:30pm"").
duration(""1 day""; ""3 days""; ""11 days""; ""12 days"").

% Ensure that Polly is not herbivorous.
not_herbivorous(Polly).

% Ensure that each sheep is herbivorous.
herbivorous(Sheep).
```

Note that these ASP rules define the relations among the categories of constants for each problem. The rules ensure that the constants are assigned correctly and that no two items share the same category value.","To extract all constraints from the clues in each problem using only the provided constants and predicates, we need to analyze the given clues and identify the logical rules that can be derived from them.

**Problem 1**

From clue 1, we have:
```prolog
P = 325 :- match(E, P, W), E = ""Bonita"".
```
This implies that Bonita's piece costs $325.

From clue 2, we have:
```prolog
P1 > P2 :- match(E1, P1, W1), match(E2, P2, W2), W1 = ""poplar"", E2 = ""Yvette"".
```
This implies that the item made of poplar costs more than Yvette's piece.

From clue 3, we have:
```prolog
P1 = P2 - 50 :- match(E1, P1, W1), match(E2, P2, W2), E1 = ""Tabitha"", W2 = ""sandalwood"".
```
This implies that Tabitha's item costs $50 less than the piece made of sandalwood.

From clue 4, we have:
```prolog
{W = ""ash""; E = ""Yvette""} = 1 :- match(E, P, W), P = 275.
```
This implies that Yvette's piece is either the piece made of ash or costs $275.

We can combine these clues to derive additional constraints. For example:
```prolog
P1 > 275 :- match(E1, P1, W1), E1 \= ""Yvette"", W1 = ""poplar"".
```
This implies that any item made of poplar costs more than $275.

**Problem 2**

From clue 1, we have:
```prolog
{C = ""Bolivia""; G = 3; S = 6; C = ""Argentina""} = 1 :- assign(C, S, G).
```
This implies that the team from Bolivia won 3 gold medals and the team from Argentina won 6 silver medals.

From clue 2, we have:
```prolog
C1 \= C2 :- assign(C1, S1, G1), assign(C2, S2, G2), C1 = ""Oman"", S2 = 10.
```
This implies that the team from Oman and the team that won 10 silver medals are different.

From clue 3, we have:
```prolog
{G = 2; G = 1} = 1 :- assign(C, S, G), C = ""Oman"".
```
This implies that either the team from Oman won 2 gold medals or won 1 gold medal.

We can combine these clues to derive additional constraints. For example:
```prolog
C1 \= C2 :- assign(C1, S1, G1), assign(C2, S2, G2), C1 = ""Oman"", G1 \= G2.
```
This implies that the team from Oman and any other team with a different number of gold medals are distinct.

**Problem 3**

From clue 1, we have:
```prolog
not_herbivorous(Polly).
```
This implies that Polly is not herbivorous.

From clue 2, we have no information about the months or times constants. However, from clue 3, we have:
```prolog
herbivorous(Sheep).
```
This implies that each sheep is herbivorous.

We can combine these clues to derive additional constraints. For example:
```prolog
not_herbivorous(Polly), herbivorous(Sheep).
```
This implies that Polly is not a sheep.

Note that the given problems do not provide enough information to determine all possible values for the constants and predicates.

% Ensure that no two queens share the same row or column.
not_assign(Row, Col1), not_assign(Row2, Col2), Row \= Row2, Col1 \= Col2.

{employee(E): price(P), wood_type(W)}=1 :- employee(E).

% Ensure that no two items share the same employee, price, or wood type.
